# Billy 1.0
EECS 330 Project - Winter 2017

A simple user interface to track website browsing habits.

The latest build/release is up and running [here](https://williamh8642.000webhostapp.com/). This project utilizes the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) Blade templating engine for rendering pages, implemented as a standalone component from [PhiloNL](https://github.com/PhiloNL/Laravel-Blade).

## Configuration
After cloning or forking the repository, navigate to the root project directory and give the command
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
Substitute 8000 with another port number if you wish.

Point your browser at the localhost port number to see the current state of the website.
